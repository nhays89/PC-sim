# PC-Sim
This project is an abstraction of a computerâ€™s data path design using object-oriented programming in C with supporting GIMP Toolkit (GTK) libraries to provide front-end display. The model is built in accordance with the 32-bit LC-2200 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) which supports four addressing modes (R-type, I-type, J-type, and O-type) with a total of 8 instructions: ADD, NAND, ADDI, LW, SW, BEQ, JALR, and NOP. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) will use this instruction set to orchestrate the fetch, decode and execution cycles of the data path. The CPU has references to its memory, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), register set, Program Counter (PC), and Instruction Register (IR). These structures serve as the core program model which allow the CPU to drive the data path to realize the instruction set.
